"You will be the only tourists North of here and make sure you stay on the main road as they are recruiting Islamic terrorists in the villages on the other side of the river".
This was said to us by a German Guy who has been in Mali since 1982 in his Hotel in Segou.
Mali north of Bamako is lovely and we took the road which heads to Mopti and Timbuktu. 
We stayed in a small fishing village not far from Makala with Helmut who is renting a house there. Everyone was amazing and we were made so welcome..as you can see from the pics.
Watching life in the village was better than Sky TV...
Got a fisherman to take us out on the river and watched him dive in the water with a net 1 meter by 1 meter..we have no idea how he got the fish!!??
Visited a Hotel that was finished in 2013..just as the extremists pushed south..its been empty ever since. (Pic of Heike and Helmut)
The pics with loads of people is Segou...the rest are as we hung out in the village.
Our car is just too visible, so after a week we headed back to Bamako..didnt want to push our luck too far..shame as the places and people are great.
